1) Make sure you update application.conf with the correct paths and destination names.
2) If you're having authentication issues you may need to set up a keystore.
    Here are the steps:

    Download and install openSSL: http://www.openssl.org/
    Open up the site in Internet Explorer and save the certificate as a Base-64 Encoded .cer (ex: example.cer)

    Then you need to convert to a .der certificate with the following command:
        openssl x509 -in example.cer -out example.der -outform DER

    Then finally add it to your keystore:
        keytool -import -alias example -file c:\users\yourname\desktop\example.der -keystore "keystore.jks"

    Copy this keystore to your project somewhere and update the keystorePath and keystorePass in your application.conf
